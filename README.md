Setting both `kCIInputAllowDraftModeKey` and `kCIInputScaleFactorKey` on `CIRAWFilter` created with a ProRaw image results in incorrect resizing of the image. An extra affine transform of a power of 2 down sample factor nearest to the set scale factor is applid. When the scale factor is `0.0825893`, an additional scale transform of `1/8` is applid.
